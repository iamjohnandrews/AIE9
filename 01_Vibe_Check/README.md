## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: ✅ 
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: ✅ 
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: ✅ 
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: ✅ 
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: ✅ 

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer: 3/5 answers were correct and useful. The other two answers, that asked the LLM to rewrite input, were not useful.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of a career change from a software engineering manager to an AI Applications engineer."
- "What are the pros and cons of AI Agent Engineer versus AI Applications Engineer as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up text to a good friend who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for my four year old daughter."
- "What can I cook with cottage cheese, cream cheese, apples, and protein powder in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: How far is the moon from earth?
   - Result: The average distance from the Earth to the Moon is about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). However, this distance can vary slightly due to the Moon's elliptical orbit around the Earth. If you're feeling curious about space, that's great! It's a wonderful way to inspire your imagination and think about the vastness of the universe. If you have any thoughts or feelings about this, or if you'd like to explore more topics, feel free to share!
2. Prompt: What should I do if I can't get an ex-girlfriend out of my head?
   - Result: It’s completely natural to feel this way after a relationship ends, and it’s okay to take time to process your feelings. Here are some practical steps you can take to help move forward:

> 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: Allow yourself to feel what you’re feeling. It’s normal to miss someone who played a significant role in your life. Journaling can be a great way to express these emotions.

> 2. **Limit Contact**: If possible, consider taking a break from social media or other means of communication with your ex. This can help create some emotional distance.

> 3. **Stay Busy**: Engage in activities that you enjoy or try something new. This can help shift your focus and fill your time with positive experiences.

> 4. **Talk About It**: Share your feelings with friends or family. Sometimes just verbalizing what you’re going through can provide relief.

> 5. **Set Goals**: Focus on personal goals or new projects. This can be a great way to redirect your energy into something productive.

> 6. **Practice Mindfulness**: Techniques such as meditation or deep breathing can help you stay grounded and present, reducing anxiety about the past.

> 7. **Seek Professional Help**: If you find it particularly challenging to cope, consider talking to a therapist. They can provide tailored strategies to help you process your feelings.

> Be gentle with yourself during this time. Healing takes time, and it’s important to be patient. You’re taking steps in the right direction just by seeking advice!
3. Prompt: Give me the best podcasts to listen to in order to become an AI applications Engineer
   - Result: Becoming an AI Applications Engineer is an exciting journey, and listening to the right podcasts can enhance your knowledge and keep you motivated. Here are some of the best podcasts you might find helpful:

> 1. **AI Alignment Podcast** - This podcast focuses on the philosophical and technical challenges of ensuring AI systems are aligned with human values.

> 2. **Data Skeptic** - It covers various topics in data science, machine learning, and AI, featuring interviews with experts in the field.

> 3. **The TWIML AI Podcast** - Hosted by Sam Charrington, it dives into the latest trends and research in AI and machine learning, featuring industry leaders and researchers.

> 4. **The AI Alignment Forum** - This podcast discusses the latest findings and theories in AI safety and alignment, making it ideal for those interested in the ethical implications of AI.

> 5. **Learning Machines 101** - This podcast provides insights into the theory and application of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

> 6. **The AI Podcast by NVIDIA** - It features interviews with AI researchers and innovators discussing their work and the future of AI technology.

> 7. **The Data Science Podcast** - This explores various aspects of data science and its applications, making it relevant for anyone looking to work in AI.

>  8. **The Changelog** - While not exclusively focused on AI, it covers a wide range of tech topics, including software development practices that are applicable to AI projects.

> As you listen, try to take notes on concepts or tools that are new to you, and consider how you can apply what you learn. Keep up the great work—your dedication will pay off!

#### ❓Question #2: 

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes. I like on the first prompt that the LLM not only went through pros & cons but also responded with questions I should consider before proceeding with a career change. For the birthday surprise prompt, I included the age of my daughter and the LLM provided a robust response that included different party themes, toddler activities, food suggestions, and planning steps for a birthday party. Very helpful, and I will use in real life. Same experience with the last prompt about cooking suggestions - robust response.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: When is my next doctors appointment?
   - Result: Your next doctor's appointment is on Tuesday, January 20, at 5:15 PM, for your annual physical with Dr. Tearani Joyce Williams. It's great that you're taking care of your health! If you have any questions or need to prepare for it, feel free to ask.
2. Prompt: What is better for me, mobility work or yoga?
   - Result: Both mobility work and yoga offer fantastic benefits, and the choice between them often depends on your specific goals and preferences.

> **Mobility Work** focuses on improving the range of motion in your joints and enhancing overall movement quality. It can be particularly beneficial if you're looking to increase your flexibility, reduce the risk of injury, or improve your performance in sports or physical activities.

> **Yoga**, on the other hand, combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. It's great for improving flexibility, strength, and balance, but it also emphasizes mindfulness and relaxation, which can be very helpful for stress management and enhancing mental clarity.

> If you're looking for a more dynamic approach to flexibility and movement, mobility work might be the way to go. If you want a holistic practice that includes physical, mental, and emotional benefits, yoga may be a better fit.

> Consider trying out both to see which resonates more with you! You could even incorporate both into your routine, using mobility work on some days and yoga on others. How does that sound to you?

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: With the current calendar integration, the mental coach app cannot tell me about past events. Also, when I asked the prompt “What does my schedule look like tomorrow?” Instead of saying, there’s nothing planned, it responded with the next event which is three days from now. To improve this application, I will need to provide it a lot more guidance and feature requirements.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1
##### Adjustments Made:
Used Google Calendar API so anyone with a google account could login and automatically see calendar as well as get customized responses from the 'Mental Coach'

##### Results:
1. Had to disable Vercel authentication in order for Cursor to access and test
2. Must make sure redirect URIs and environment variables are correct, and you have to update the google console’s redirect URIs with the newest Vercel build URL every time
3. Had a date issue and Cursor discovered solution from reviewing the terminal logs, the API is returning correct future dates (Jan 17, 18, 20, 21...), but the UI is showing stale/cached data with an old event from Jan 14. I learned that you need to delete the cache whenever you return and start working on a project

---

### Four lessons learned
 1. When troubleshooting with Cursor, copy & paste the entire error log into Cursor agent
 2. For Activity #1, the second and fifth prompts were rewriting requests (e.g. summarize and professional tone) and the LLM’s output was very similar to the input. It appears that when there is a rewriting request, the prompt must be more descriptive and detailed
 3. For math prompts, the LLM’s response automatically provides ‘train of thought’ so you don’t have to ask to show LLM’s logic/reasoning

### Three lessons not yet learned
 1. How to add ‘constraints/rules’ to my app in order to tailor LLM response (e.g. explain things to an adult audience)
 2. How to incorporate traces in order to inspect workflows and understand the user experience
 3. How to use AI in order to test my app (i.e. Monte Carlo simulation in Excel)
